This program takes a system of equations, runs it through the Gaussian elimination with scaled partial pivots, and returns the solved values for the X's.

To run this program, simply run the .exe file.
If you plan to use a file to input your coefficients, please make sure that file is in the SAME directory as the executable file.
Same applies if you are trying to use a file with the .py file, must be in the same directory.
